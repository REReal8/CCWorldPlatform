# CCWorldPlatform
A project that aims to create a Minecraft world based on ComputerCraft (Tweaked) in which turtles work distributed to create and manage a Minecraft World.

The idea is to create a library of files that allows for Turtles to work autonomously together in the minecraft world to accomplish something. 
The ultimate goal is to be able to start with 1 single turtle with a minimum amount of resources (one modem, one sapling, one pickage, one crafting table) that autonomously creates a world, adds functionality (including other turtles) in that world to finnally accomplish a huge project (like building the eiffel tower).

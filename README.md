# CCWorldPlatform
A project that aims to create a Minecraft world based on [ComputerCraft](https://www.computercraft.info/) ([Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/)) in which turtles work distributed together to create and accomplish something in a Minecraft World.

The setup is to create a library of files that allows for Turtles to work autonomously together in the minecraft world to accomplish something. 

The ultimate goal is to be able to start with 1 single turtle with a minimum amount of resources (a modem, a pickaxe, one sapling and one crafting table) that autonomously creates a world, adds functionality (including other turtles) in that world to finally accomplish a huge project (like building the eiffel tower).

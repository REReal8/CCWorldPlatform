ToDo List
---------
--[[
   This section of this file contains the list of things we as developers (G & R) would like, or are considering to, ToDo w.r.t. the ccwp development project.

   ToDo List conventions:
   -  ToDo line
      -  A ToDo line start with either a "-" or the first letter of the name of the developer that has or intents to pickup the ToDo
      -  A ToDo line contains a brief description of what we want to do.
   -  Sub ToDo's
      -  ToDo's can contain sub ToDo's by adding them on the lines following the parent ToDo, and indenting the line with 3 spaces
      -  Grouping related ToDo's, in a list of sub ToDo's, is a good practice (especially if they are intended to be picked up in the same timeframe)
   -  Priority
      -  ToDo's which the developer(s) deem to have a higher priority can/will be put higher in the ToDo List.
   -  Completed ToDo's
      -  When a ToDo is completed "(done)" should be added at the end of the ToDo line
      -  A ToDo with sub ToDo's should only be marked as done if all sub ToDo's are also done
      -  When a master ToDo (i.e. those who do not have a parent ToDo) is marked as done, the other developer should move the ToDo (including the sub ToDo's)
         to the ToDo history section of this file to indicate he/ she has taken notice of the completion of the ToDo.

G  Debug: Modem events send but not received
   - understand (seems buffer issue inside computercraft)
   - resolve/ workaround (workaround, not solved. Sync code should consider yielding)
   - option to bundle messages, reduces count, not size. (done)

R  Generalise test functions into "templates" to reduce duplication

G  Descriptions for blueprints and project steps
   G  Blueprint layer holds a desription / name
   G  used to pass to project step (zodat het in de status schermen te zien is)
   G  description field for debugging (done, use projectMeta.title and projectMeta.description)
   G  project stappen kunnen een naam krijgen, add e.g stepName = "kaas" field to step block, e.g.
         { stepType = "SSrv", stepName = "kaas", stepTypeDef = { moduleName = "enterprise_test", serviceName = "Test_SSrv" }, stepDataDef = {
                { keyDef = "testArg"        , sourceStep = 0, sourceKeyDef = "testTable4" },
         }},
      en worden gebruikt voor sourceStep's, e.g.
         { keyDef = "testArg"        , sourceStep = "kaas", sourceKeyDef = "testArgSource" },

R  Factory:
   -  remove static method style code (remaining from before it was a mobj)
   -  ensure no longer need to register it as a module in the mobj library
   -  split into CraftSpot & SmeltSpot MObj's

-  blueprint
   -  Introduce Blueprint objects

-  Improve MObjHost
   -  Support updating of MObj's

-  ItemSupplierGroup & ItemDepotGroup
   -  there seems to be a pattern where multiple (m)obj's handle groups of ItemSupplier's (or ItemDepot's), e.g.
      -  in the Shop (or WasteHandler)
      -  for top chests
      -  for storage "chests" in the Silo
      -  in the Factory?
   -  part of this code is/ seems to be the same
   -  we should investigate if we can introduce a ItemSupplierGroup object that implements the common code that can subsequentyly be reused.

-  waste handling (equivalent aan de shop: enterprise_wastehandling + (m)obj_wastehandler) (enterprise_wastehandling?)
   -  v1
      RG adjust part of IItemSupplier:provideItemsTo_AOSrv to get a wasteItemDepotLocator as argument                      (done)
      R  add wasteItemDepotLocator to methods where (p|P)rovideItemsTo_AOSrv, and the parent methods of those, are used    (done)
      -  gebruik wasteItemDepotLocator in factory (done)
      -  gebruik wasteItemDepotLocator in forest, contruction
      G  forrester return havested items so waste can be calculated
   -  v2
      -  create obj_wastehandler and enterprise_wastehandling
      -  turtle registers in (m)obj_wastehandler
      -  rename enterprise_storage into enterprise_warehousing
      -  silo registers in (m)obj_wastehandler
   -  v3
      -  registers local chests of mobj's (forest, factory, etc) in (mo)bj_wastehandler
      -  ensure it takes the closest

-  Availability of space (e.g. no 2 turtles into 1 silo shaft)
   - denk richting:
      -  silo managed de beweging door de shaft
      -  oplossingrichting:
         -  specifieke projectstap eo assignment voor de MoveTo stap met een beschikbaarheids token voor de shaft die om een aantal project stappen heen staat
         -  bijv. de stappen: [move de shaft in, haal items uit een storage kist, move de shaft uit] (binnen een protected sequence dmv de token)

-  mobj advanced chest
   -  different class like mobj chest
   -  handles orders with item reservation
      -  discuss: should this be part of/ handled via improved IItemSupplier interface (i.e. be applicable to all ItemSupplier's)?
   -  handles waste with free space reservation
      -  discuss: should this be part of/ handled via improved IItemDepot interface  (i.e. be applicable to all ItemDepot's)?
   -  when items are pickup up / delivered, reservation is complete

RG mine v2
   -  uitdenken
   -  maken

-  Consider creating and using order objects
   -  order object that holds an outstanding order
   -  order object holds the items concerned
   -  order object can hold more information, like description
   -  this will make an overview of outstanding orders possible

-  object new methods:
   -  consider return nil after a CheckInput failure (instead of empty table).
      -  this propably depends on the usage of new. In case of constructing an instance we DO want to return a table. And we should set it's fields.
      -  this might change if we implement the toTable and fromTable serialise/ deserialising logic
   -  goed testen dat alles nog goed gaat.

-  Obj(ect) Initialisation & Destruction: improve
   R  rename section base methods => initialisation                                                                     (done)
   R  remove new from IObj (+ move most implementations to correct section)                                             (done)
   -  ToDiscuss: Consider revising Initialisation, some aspects to consider
      -  Serialising and deserialising objects
         -  consider introducting methods (new)FromTable and serialiseToTable
         -  provide a default implementing class
         -  replace current new method in almost all current objects with the above
      -  Consider introducing normal "new" method that takes a list of parameters (not as a table) from which objects are initialissed
      -  construct method (and destruct methods) currently in IMObj
         -  adopt/ change to the above "new" method, i.e.
            -  it should not take a table with the parameters + the parameters itself (change MObjHost to reflect this change)
            -  possibly remove them from IMObj but introduce some other mechanism for enforcing hosting child objects (via MObjHost:hostMObj_SSrv)
      -  Consider introducing one or more interfaces (e.g. IInitialisation) for the above initialisation related methods

-  Revise modules/ libraries file directory structure

-  hosting/ releasing, building/ dismantling v2.0
   -  There are several aspects that could be taken into account in an upgraded version. Likely good to discuss:
      -  mobj_shop (currently) does not have a physical presence in the world. Hence having build and dismantle (both in mobj_shop as enterprise_shop) seems incorrect.
      -  mobj_shop can however have WIP. Waiting for WIP to be completed now is done in dismantleAndReleaseMObj_ASrv
      -  the above will also be the case for enterprise_wastehandling/(m)obj_wastehandler, and possibly also when we introduce ItemSupplierGroup and ItemDepotGroup
      -  should we introduce some intermediate abstraction between IObj and IMObj, e.g. IHObj (hostable Obj), or IWObj (Workable Obj), or IAObj (async Obj)?

-  Construction from front
   -  Support building blueprints (layers) from front

-  enterprise_project
   !  consider introducing a Project object (class)!, and using that in enterprise_project
   -  (nested?) sequential projectStep
            { stepType = "SerialSteps", stepTypeDef = { aoWIPId = "myId", }, stepDataDef = {                                        -- sourceStep = 10 (or stepName)
                { stepType = "SSrv", stepTypeDef = { moduleName = "enterprise_test", serviceName = "Test_SSrv" }, stepDataDef = {   -- sourceStep = 10.1
                    { keyDef = "testArg"        , sourceStep = 0, sourceKeyDef = "testArgSource" },
                }},
                { stepType = "ASrv", stepTypeDef = { moduleName = "enterprise_test", serviceName = "Test_ASrv" }, stepDataDef = {   -- sourceStep = 10.2
                    { keyDef = "testArg"        , sourceStep = 0, sourceKeyDef = "testArgSource" },
                }},

                -- additional steps to perform in sequence                                                                          -- sourceStep = 10.n

                returnData  = {
                    { keyDef = "testBArg0"              , sourceStep = 0, sourceKeyDef = "testArgSource" },
                }
            }},
   -  (nested?) parellel projectStep
            { stepType = "ParellelSteps", stepTypeDef = { aoWIPId = "myId", }, stepDataDef = {
                -- as above with any stepType (including SerialSteps), i.e.
                -- sourceStep = 11.1
                --              11.1.1
                --              11.1.2 S
                --              11.2

                -- additional steps to perform in parellel                                                                          -- sourceStep = 11.n
            }},
   -  error handling (no_error, ignored errors, failed on error)

-  improve IItemDepot and IItemSupplier interfaces
   -  claiming items (in IItemSupplier)
   -  free slots (in IItemDepot's)

-  enterprise management
   -  for claiming manament execution time

-  player station
   -  v1.0: input & output chest UI

-  IItemSupplier & IItemDepot interface
   -  consider better name for provideTo and storeFrom reflecting the fact that storeFrom is simpler
   -  don't do anything when itemList is empty --> where do check?

-  World Master
   -  Wil 1 ding: upgrade to the next level (via using (mobj)enterprises)
   -  Or other alternative without scripting (via levels)

-  recipe book

-  Bug: Factory:provideItemsTo_AOSrv meerdere items zorgt voor meerdere keren aanroepen van callback terwijl het er maar 1 moet zijn

-  create (& use) multiple turtles

-  enterprise_energy
   -  Investigate + possibly fix why we relatively soon need to go to L3 enterprise_energy in enterprise_colonization
   -  coal fuel (v5 enterprise)

-  tool management
   -  does a turtle have it's own tools?

-  Bij inschrijven assigment controleren of er een pickaxe in de inventory zit (indien not equiped)

-  moveTo:
   - v2.0: (snel) wegen (veel)

-  concept: stand alone turtles / turtle slaves
   -  turtle without wireless network possibility
   -  turtle does one job, no rotation (like forestry or mining)
   -  turtle stops when output chest is full / low on fuel
   -  turtle continues when output chest is cleared / fuel is delivered
   -  optional computer nearby for information hub, maybe wired connected
   +++can be build with materials found, no given modems needed
   ---differs alot from current implementation

-  Other ToDo's to be found everywhere in all code files


ToDo history
------------
--[[
   This section of this file contains the ToDo items that have been fully completed, and that all developers acknowledge to have seen.


   ToDo History conventions:
   -  Newly completed and acknowledged ToDo's should be added at the top of this list. Hence, older ToDo's will be lower on the list.
